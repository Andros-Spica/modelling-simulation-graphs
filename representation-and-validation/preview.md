# Representation and validation of simulation models in archaeology

Diagram showing the (potential) epistemological role of simulation modelling in archaeological research. Highlighted are the aspects of representation (how models are linked to a target reality) and validation (how to assure that the model dynamics, or simulated data, is compatible with the available empirical data). A second derivative diagram shows how the epistemological connections change whenever descriptive mathematical modelling are used instead of mechanistic ones.
