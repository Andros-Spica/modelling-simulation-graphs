# Modelling and Simulation Open Graphs

Open source diagrams and info-graphics about various aspects characterising mathematical modelling and simulation. Feel free to clone and use it in any way you want. To contribute, please follow the rules in the section below.

List of graphs and their versions:
- [**_From model to simulation models_**](from-model-to-simulation-models/preview.md). 
- [**_Simulation and Machine Learning: potential combinations_**](simulation-and-ml/preview.md).  
- [**_Representation and validation of simulation models in archaeology_**](representation-and-validation/preview.md).  

## Disclaimer

The diagrams stored here are the outcome of a distinctive level of expertise and a relatively broad understanding of the most common forms of mathematical modelling and simulation. However, all diagrams are products of scholarship and as such should be taken with healthy levels of criticism and can be improved.

Is something contradicting/ignoring important points for you? Contribute proposing an modification or a new graph, attaching notes about the reasoning behind it!

## For contributors

You can use any source format able to represent graphs and generate image files. The default tool used here is [yEd - graph editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) which is free, easy to use and works with Windows, Unix/Linux, and macOS. Whenever contributing in formats not compatible so far, please add to the table below the format and application of choice used to edit your contribution.
